# Big Mart Sales Prediction

Overview: This repository contains my solution to the BigMart Sales Prediction hackathon, aimed at forecasting product sales across BigMart outlets using 2013 data. By applying data science and machine learning, the model highlights key factors influencing sales, offering insights for BigMart's strategic decisions.

Problem Statement: The goal is to predict sales for each product-store pair using historical data from 1,559 products across 10 stores, even with potential missing data from reporting issues.

Dataset: The dataset includes:
- Products: 1,559 items with attributes like type, weight, and visibility.
- Stores: 10 stores with features like location type, size, and type.

Solution Approach:
- Preprocessing: Cleaned data and handled missing values.
- Feature Engineering: Added features to boost model performance.
- Modeling: Used and optimized several machine learning models.
- Evaluation: Assessed accuracy with metrics like RMSE.
